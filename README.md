The MERN stack for video call app is a GitHub repository that contains code for building a web-based video calling application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) technology stack. The application includes features like user authentication, real-time video calling using WebRTC, and a simple chat interface.

The front-end of the application is built using React.js and styled with CSS. The back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js, and data is stored in a MongoDB database. WebRTC technology is used for the video calling functionality, while Socket.io is used to handle real-time communication between users.

The repository includes all the necessary files and code for building and running the application, along with instructions for setting up and configuring the project. The application can be deployed to a hosting service like Heroku or AWS to make it accessible on the web.
